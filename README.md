**Precipitation Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting precipitation in Thanjavur district using three different recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and vanilla RNN. The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of these models in real-time precipitation prediction based on historical data spanning from 1980 to 2022.

**Models Used
**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
Description: LSTM is a type of RNN that is well-suited for learning and remembering over long sequences.


**GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):
Description: GRU is another variant of RNN that simplifies the architecture compared to LSTM, aiming to achieve similar performance with fewer parameters.


**RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):
Description: The standard RNN architecture was also implemented for comparison with more advanced models like LSTM and GRU.

**Data
The real-time data used for this project covers precipitation records in Thanjavur district from 1980 to 2022. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the models.

**Performance Metrics
To assess the performance of the models, the following metrics were used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
R2 Score
Mean Square Error(MSE)
Mean Bias Deviation (MBD)
